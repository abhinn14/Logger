IoT and ML Project: Anomaly Detection with “Logger”.

We’ve developed Logger, a smart split-AC monitoring device that continuously captures humidity, temperature, vibration, voltage, and current readings to deliver real-time insights into system health and performance.

The receiver system plots and detects anomalies from the data using machine learning, enabling proactive maintenance.
